JavaScript/jQuery handles menu selection and dynamic display. Returns itemized receipt for multiple orders. Incorporates Bootstrap grid system, panels, and modal windows to demonstrate basic responsiveness.

This project was originally a JavaScript final assignment at The Tech Academy. I continued on to incorporate Bootstrap. In addition to achieving complete functionality, successes included utilizing jQuery to dynamically switch out Bootstrap panels in mobile view for dynamic grid system in med - large views. Also, pushing and pulling dynamic grid items to alter layouts at various screen sizes. 

Future updates may include improvements to visual/ graphic design and utilizing CSS animations/ transistions.
